        <p>TikTok
            TikTok has changed the game for social media. It is a platform much like Instagram but JUST videos. Many people believe TikTok is brand new, but in actual fact itâ€™s been around for much longer. TikTok actually was once a well known app Musical.ly but changed its name to TikTok in August 2018.</p>

        <p>The brand owner of Musical.ly decided it would be better to merge its community with those of TikTok to gain a better recognition within the industry. The decision was certainly a good one as now TikTok is worth over a whopping 80 BILLION.</p> 

        <p>TikTok is fastly becoming one of the most used APPS on the app store. One of the main reasons is because of its analytics. A user may go onto instagram and receive maybe 4/5k views on their work, but on TikTok, their work is reaching numbers by the millions. </p>
